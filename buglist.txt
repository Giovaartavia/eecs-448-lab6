List of purposely inserted bugs:

1. isEmpty is always true.
2. removeFront and removeBack do nothing. This includes not removing anything and not affecting the size of the list. They also always return false.
3. addBack adds elements in disorder. It does the same as addFront
4. The list allows for doubles to be given as input but it converts them to ints. Still, doubles are allowed to be given to the list.
